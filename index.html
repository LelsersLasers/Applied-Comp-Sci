        I mean who doesn't want a Ferrari? Fast, loud, and expensive, they are the ultimate show of prestige.
        However, to use a Ferrari (which is a car), you have to be able to drive - and I can't.
        Well techinally I have a learners permit, but in the driving lesson it was mostly my teacher yelling something
        along the lines of "WHERE U TRYING TO HIT THOSE PEOPLE?" as I randomly swerved around trying to go straight.
        Also because it is just a learners permit, I have to have a parent in the car, and that kind of ruins the 'cool factor'
        of driving a Ferrari.
        <br><br>Here is a link to the
        <a class="normalLink" href="https://www.ferrari.com/en-US/">
            Ferrari main website,
        </a>
        and here is a link to the 
        <a class="normalLink" href="https://www.ferrari.com/en-US/auto/car-range?from=GWvideo">
            available models.
        </a>
        <br>As for the cost, they cost a lot...  $fill-in$?????????????? Remember that there is a speed limit, so unless you plan on breaking the law
        and running from police, there is no reason to need to go faster than 65-70 mph making a Ferrari very unlogical.

        Again, who wouldn't want a bigger house? Large, spacoius, and usually with a ocean view and/or multiple pools.
        You spend most of your time in your house, either sleeping, homework (which I am definitely doing not playing video games,
        how dare you suggest that), cooking (read: setting toaster over on fire), or eating (mostly pasta, some pizza, lots of chocolate).
        A bigger house gives you more space, and often can me more relaxing as you don't feel like you are being smashed.
        Also, the extra space lets you have more things (because you have more space to store them).
        I don't care much for pools, but again, why not? As for ocean view, that would be quite nice. Imagine sitting on the
        4th story deck of your house looking at the sun hovering over the ocean while you rip your hair out doing English homework.
        However, a large house has it's downsides. It's less 'cozy' feeling, and it takes a lot more to clean it/keep it organized.
        Also, my immediate family has only 4 people, so we don't really need the extra space, and imagine having to walk 4 flights
        of stairs to get the pen you forgot in your room.
        <br><br>As for costs, they can get a bit price-y. Some go for $fill-in$??????????????

    <h3 id="h3-3" class="sectionHead">Here is my car</h3>
    <img src="car.jpg" alt="Picture failed to load" width=350 height=200 />
    <p>
        As a big of a side track, here is my car. Unfortunately it's an RC car (this however has it's benifits which I will get into later).
        I built it from a kit, available at
        <a class="normalLink" href="https://www.tamiyausa.com/shop/110-4wd-shaft-drive-road-tt/rc-tt-02r-chassis-kit-2/">
            here.
        </a>
        But because it's an RC car, I still do need a car (once I can drive), thus I want a Ferrari
    </p>

    <h3 id="h3-4" class="sectionHead">I also want this car</h3>
    <img src="car2.PNG" alt="Picture failed to load" width=200 height=350 />
    <p>
        It is a gas car, but a RC car. It is also giant (and expensive).
        Also it is loud, so it can't be driven near people's houses.
        If you want to buy one for me, here is the
