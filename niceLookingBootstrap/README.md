# Bootstrap Assignment

Features:

    - Navbar at top using scrollspy to automatically update the active colors
    - "Sign up" bar under title with a text input, a dropdown menu, and a spinner (aligned to the left using row/col)
    - Cards in a table that adjusts its side (row/col)
    - Text/Typography for the poem text, the quotes, highlighting etc
    - Javascript buttons ("Magic 1", "Magic 2" at bottom of site)


Things in simple:

    - Scrollspy (in Navbar)
    - Spinner
    - Cards
    - Text/Typography
    - Dropdown
    - Jumbotron
    - Input box
    - "Magic" buttons (Javascript)


Note: I used a blue border to make things easier to see/debug/fix for the row/col stuff.
That is why a lot of elements randomly have a "blue" class.
