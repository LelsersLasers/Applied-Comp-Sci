                For English, we had to read this poem.
                I thought it was about hunting toads.
                This webpage will discuss the reasons why I thought it was about
                huntining toads, and why it was not about huntining toads.

                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <pre>

In memory of Donatus Nwoga

When human beings found out about death
They sent the dog to Chukwu with a message:
They wanted to be let back to the house of life.
They didn’t want to end up lost forever
Like burnt wood disappearing into smoke
Or ashes that get blown away to nothing.
Instead, they saw their souls in a flock at twilight
Cawing and headed back for the same old roosts
And the same bright airs and wing-stretches each morning.
Death would be like a night spent in the wood:
At first light they’d be back in the house of life.
(The dog was meant to tell all this to Chukwu).

But death and human beings took second place
When he trotted off the path and started barking
At another dog in broad daylight just barking
Back at him from the far bank of a river.

<mark id="markSection">And that is how the toad reached Chukwu first,
The toad who’d overheard in the beginning
What the dog was meant to tell. ‘Human beings,’ he said
(And here the toad was trusted absolutely),
‘Human beings want death to last forever.’</mark>

Then Chukwu saw the people’s souls in birds
Coming towards him like black spots off the sunset
To a place where there would be neither roosts nor trees
Nor any way back to the house of life.
And his mind reddened and darkened all at once
And nothing that the dog would tell him later
Could change that vision. Great chiefs and great loves
In obliterated light, the toad in the mud,
The dog crying out all night behind the corpse house.</pre>

                        And why I thought it was about toads

                    <p>
                        I mean, how could it not be about toads?
                        It literally says that toads caused this all.
                        What else could
                        <pre>    ‘Human beings,’ he said
    (And here the toad was trusted absolutely),
    ‘Human beings want death to last forever.’</pre>
                        mean? It clearly means that the toad caused this all,
                        right? At least that is what I though it meant.
                        I also failed to understand what "Chukwu" was.
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">
                            " Chukwu is the supreme being of
                            <mark>Igbo</mark>
                            spirituality. In the Igbo pantheon, Chukwu is the
                            source of all other Igbo deities and is responsible
                            for assigning them their different tasks. The Igbo people
                            believe that all things come from Chukwu, who brings the
                            rain necessary for plants to grow and controls everything
                            on Earth and the spiritual world. They believe Chukwu
                            to be an undefinable omnipotent and omnipresent supreme
                            deity that encompasses everything in space and space itself. "

                        However because of my bad hand writing, I read
                        <mark>Igbo</mark>
                        as
                        <mark>Igloo</mark>.
                        This caused a lot of problems. The first one was
                        that it made "Chukwu" the "supreme being of
                        <mark>Igloo</mark>".
                        Not only does that sentence not make any sense, it also
                        influnced my understanding of the poem. Igloos are usally
                        in very cold places, meaning that farming/agriculture is not
                        an option. This to me meant that these people in the story
                        were hunters (only way to get food). Thus the idea of 
                        hunting came about. So, with toads being the 'bad guys'
                        and hunting also an 'imporant' meaning, it is clear that
                        that the poem is about hunting toads.

                    <h5>
                        And why its not about toads

                    <p>
                        If you understand Chukwu, the poem gets a lot clearer and
                        becomes less about toads. Chukwu, being the supreme god
                        controls life and death. When the humans find out they could
                        die permanently, they don't like it, and they want to not
                        be dead (who can blame them?). So they send the dog to
                        tell Chukwu that they want to not be permanently dead, but
                        the dog gets distracted and instead of the dog telling
                        Chukwu that the humans don't wnt to be dead, the toad tells
                        him that they do want dead to last forever. The dog tried
                        to convince Chukwu that the toad is lying, but he is unable
                        to. The dog is then seen crying behind the corpse house,
                        showing that he feels responsible. This related back to the
                        title of them poem, "A Dog Was Crying Tonight in Wicklow Also".
                        The author Seamus Heaney lived in Wicklow, and he is comparing
                        himself to the dog. He feels responsible for the death of
                        Donatus Nwoga, and that he was distracted and would have
                        been able to prevent him from dying.
