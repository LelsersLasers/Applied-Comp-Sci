# Assignment
1) An overall design strategy that makes sense for your content.
2) Use of color to accentuate and differentiate objects and sections.
3) Use Bootstrap as your main styling engine. You can modify the effects of Bootstrap using either an external style sheet or inline styles (don't use an internal style sheet).
4) If you have a Call To Action, a strategy for highlighting and drawing attention to it.
5) Good coding habits (see Topics page for list).
6) I strongly encourage (but not require) you to have more than one page. If you have more than one page, you should have some kind of breadcrumbs.
7) Your page should be responsive, so it should look different on different screen sizes.
