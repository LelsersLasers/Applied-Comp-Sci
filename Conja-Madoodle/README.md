# Notes

- Lots on "fake" links
    - like cart/more info, the links at the bottom, most of the products
- The product pages do not contain the pop out, instead it would be a link to a full page about it
    - It make it too crowded on the page when it popped out
- The random "blue" class was my border to outline/make sure things were aligned right
- All extra styling is in style.css and there is some basic JavaScript in script.js
- All the pages have a "terrible" line of code for top spacing
- I have no idea how to properly organize the project folder, so I just didn't
- Call to action / Colors:
    - Main actions in bright blue ("primary")
        - BUY NOW, Add to Cart
    - Green on success
        - for Add to Cart buttons
    - Bonus actions in muted colors
        - "Info" (a bootstrap blue) for settings, light grey for more info
    - Out of the way bottom links
        - line (hr) and very light grey to set it as not imporant (compared to the normal bright white)
    - Jumbotrons to seperate sections
        - Featured product vs others
        - (Also the rounded corners just looks nice)
