                For English, we had to read this poem.
                I thought it was about huntining toads.
                This webpage will discuss the reasons why I thought it was about
                huntining toads, and why it was not about huntining toads.
                Here is the poem:

                        A Dog Was Crying Tonight in Wicklow Also
                    </h3>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <pre>

When human beings found out about death
They sent the dog to Chukwu with a message:
They wanted to be let back to the house of life.
They didn’t want to end up lost forever
Like burnt wood disappearing into smoke
Or ashes that get blown away to nothing.
Instead, they saw their souls in a flock at twilight
Cawing and headed back for the same old roosts
And the same bright airs and wing-stretches each morning.
Death would be like a night spent in the wood:
At first light they’d be back in the house of life.
(The dog was meant to tell all this to Chukwu).

But death and human beings took second place
When he trotted off the path and started barking
At another dog in broad daylight just barking
Back at him from the far bank of a river.

<mark id="markSection">And that is how the toad reached Chukwu first,
The toad who’d overheard in the beginning
What the dog was meant to tell. ‘Human beings,’ he said
(And here the toad was trusted absolutely),
‘Human beings want death to last forever.’</mark>

Then Chukwu saw the people’s souls in birds
Coming towards him like black spots off the sunset
To a place where there would be neither roosts nor trees
Nor any way back to the house of life.
And his mind reddened and darkened all at once
And nothing that the dog would tell him later
Could change that vision. Great chiefs and great loves
In obliterated light, the toad in the mud,
The dog crying out all night behind the corpse house.</pre>

                    <p>
                        I mean, how could it not be about toads?
                        It literally says that toads caused this all.
                        What else could
                        <pre>    ‘Human beings,’ he said
    (And here the toad was trusted absolutely),
    ‘Human beings want death to last forever.’</pre>
                        mean? It clearly means that the toad caused this all,
                        right? At least that is what I though it meant.
                        I also failed to understand what "Chukwu" was.
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">

                            spirituality. In the Igbo pantheon, Chukwu is the source of all other
                            Igbo deities and is responsible for assigning them
                            their different tasks. The Igbo people believe that
                            all things come from Chukwu, who brings the rain
                            necessary for plants to grow and controls everything
                            on Earth and the spiritual world. They believe Chukwu
                            to be an undefinable omnipotent and omnipresent supreme
                            deity that encompasses everything in space and space itself. "

                        However because of my bad hand writing, I read
                        <mark>Igbo</mark>
                        as
                        <mark>Igloo</mark>.
                        This caused a lot of problems. The first one was
                        that it made "Chukwu" the "supreme being of
                        <mark>Igloo</mark>".
                        Not only does that sentence not make any sense, it also
                        influnced my understanding of the poem. Igloos are usally
                        in very cold places, meaning that farming/agriculture is not
                        an option. This to me meant that these people in the story
                        were hunters (only way to get food). Thus the idea of
