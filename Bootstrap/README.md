# Bootstrap Assinment

Features:

    - Navbar 1 at top using scrollspy to automatically update the active colors
    - Navbar 2 under title with a text input, a dropdown menu, and a spinner (aligned to the left using row/col)
    - Lots of other row/col stuff to align things
    - Cards in a table that adjusts its side (row/col)
    - Text/Typography for the poem text, the quotes, highlighting etc


Things in simple:

    - Spinner
    - Scrollspy
    - Cards
    - Text/Typography
    - Dropdown
    - (Row/col)


Note: I used a blue border to make things easier to see/fix for the row/col stuff.
To disable the blue border, just change the line in the style.css.
