# NEO CROSSER

Features/Design Choices:
- Visually Clarity
    - ALl art is hand drawn (mouse drawn) pixel art by me
    - No 'overlapping' colors
    - Nothing happens "randomly" on screen
        - Everything is predictable
    - No pointless effects
        - No particles, everything drawn has effect
    - Animated Player
        - Animation changes only when moving
        - Changes color on death (green to white)
        - Teleport leaves a trail from where you teleported to make it clear what happened
    - Animated Car/Bus
        - Wheels 'spin' based on the movement speed of the car
        - Changes color when stunned (just drawns an outline)
    - Animated UFO
        - Has a 50/50 chance to either start moving towards the player or randomly down
        - Bounces off walls
        - Hover effect thing moves (scales on speed)
        - Spawn rate increases based on score
        - Draws just an outline when stunned
    - Buildings spawn in groups
        - Random number of different textures make up the width
        - Random textures per texture in the width
        - Preserves the dimension scale
        - Can't run through them
        - Can teleport over them
            - If you teleport into them, you are put on the side you started on
- Simple Gameplay
    - Move just up/down/left/right (no diagonal)
    - Abilites are relativly straightforward to use
    - Because of simplicity, the player has freedom to do anything
        - (not you can only R when on the left side of the screen, etc)
        - Player can use multiple abilites and move at the same time
- Scoreboard/Leader Board/Top Scores
    - Saves top 10 scores with 'localStorage'
    - If your score is in the top 10, you can enter your name for it to be saved
        - Like old games it stores the first three characters (and shows them in upper case)
            - If they enter less than 3 characters, it will be filled with spaces
            - If they enter more than 3 characters, it will just take the first 3
        - Will autofill the last saved name (so you just have to hit enter to re-use it)
    - Center based on the start of the numbers
    - Different text color based on rank
        - (first: gold, second: silver, third: bronze, rest: white)
- Keyboard Support
    - W/A/S/D or Arrow Keys to move
        - Note: Arrow Keys might scroll the page not just act as inputs
    - Q/E/R or 1/2/3 for abilites
    - Enter to continue/move between screens (mouse click also works)
- Touch/Mouse support Support
    - Touch the movement keys (bottom right) to move
    - Touch the ability keys (bottom left) to activate them
- SOUND
    - Less 'clear' than visuals
    - Focus on many sounds at once
        - (Ex: R fire sound, multiple laser hits at once, while Q teleport sound finishes)
    - High Tempo (180 BPM) background music
        - no lyrics
    - Lack of clarity + high tempo = chaotic enviroment
        - Creates a sense of pressure to do something
- 'Screens'
    - Welcome
        - Clicking on the directions/top scores button will open that screen
            - Or press 'd'/'s'
        - Clicking anywhere else or pressing Enter will start the game
        - Directions/Top Scores
            - Click anywhere to return to welcome screen
    - Main Game
        - Pause menu by pressing z or CLICKING IN TOP RIGHT OR ESC KEY
            - Toggling the music will save the choice in localStorage
                - Music will not auto start if the last choice was to toggle it off
        - Dying will trigger a game over screen
            - Press Enter or click the screen to return to the welcome screen
    - Flashing text (by opacity)
- Everything is scaled with canvas.width or canvas.height
    - Designed around 900x700 px screen, but looks/works completely fine on (basically) any screen size
    - The player is a squares and scales off the height
        - (player is technically 10:11, but to keep the ratio both numbers have to scale off of 1 number) 
        - Same with on screen buttons

Other Things:
- Bars on sides to give the impression the player is moving up and down, not the cars/waters
- Cars will bounce off the edges and the buildings
    - 'Safe zones' on the other sides of buildings
- Stunned cars will still hurt the player
- Stuns stack additively
- When a car goes offscreen:
    - It always spawns a new car slightly above the top of the screen
    - Might spawn a ufo (based on score and random)
    - Might spawn a building (based on chance)
        - Will not spawn a building if the last row had a building
